# hyperhistory

simulates incoming [moonbeam](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/moonbeam) data,
the trade history server for eosfinex.


every 500 ms a new data entry comes in for either `testuser4321` or
`testuser1111`.

goal: make the data accessible for both users via hypercore,
so they can pull their data.
